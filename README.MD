# Ultimate Edition ESM Fixes Remastered for Linux
## This mod project is in no way affiliated with Kazopert

This repository is a component of the [Mirelurked Viva New Vegas] guide, and is maintained by me until (hopefully), this project is officially adopted by the relevant guide/mod authors.

It is exactly what it says on the tin, a Linux installer for the popular Fallout: New Vegas game mod, [Ultimate Edition ESM Fixes Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/92289). The mod files here are reproduced with permission from the original author, Kazopert. 

The Linux installer executable provided from the [Universal MPI Phraser](), developed & maintained by Sulfur Nitride. The installer files here are reproduced in accordance with the MIT License.

This package can be used in the same way that the original mod can be. Simply replace the word 'Installer.exe' with the word 'Installer' in your mind.
